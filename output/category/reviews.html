<li>You can be 4,000 miles away and Nubya Garcia will smack you in the face and you will say ‘thank you, Nubya.’</li>
<li>You don’t realise that this is what London sounds like until you hear it, then it’s all you can hear that London sounds like. </li>
<li>Being in the right place is just as important as being at the right time.</li>
<li>It’s not your imagination: the rainstorms are getting worse every year. </li>
<li>Paradoxical truths are harmonious. Can you hear that?</li>
<li>Joe Armon-Jones plays piano like Aladdin Sane, who plays piano like Cecil Taylor, more than anything else.</li>
<li>Nubya Garcia is a bullet that cold rocks you. No yellow ribbon, no swastika.</li>
<li>Nubya Garcia is an open-top bus tour of the mind.</li>
<li>Nubya Garcia is Juan Román Riquelme reincarnate.</li>
<li>Horoscopes are all well and good, but you can only find true intimacy in a fortune cookie.</li>
<li>This record is not recommended to anyone with a history of heart disease.</li>
<li>Hummingbirds aren’t native to Peckham, but they should be.</li>
<li>This record is, however, recommended to pregnant women.</li>
<li>This record will be the next time you consume something and it makes you feel better.</li>
<li>Striving for wellness is modern Puritanism. Pious living will not lead to immortality.</li>
<li>That said, it might not be a bad idea.</li>
<li>Nubya Garcia punches like Deontay Wilder. </li>
<li>It’s okay to be in two minds: just be confident of both of them.</li>
<li>It’s okay to feel two paradoxical things: that’s just what it feels like to sense the multiverse.</li>
<li>Nubya Garcia senses the multiverse: just listen to her, just look at the album cover.</li>
<li>It’s all your imagination: the rainstorms are not getting worse every year. </li>
<li>Listen: paradoxical truths are detaching. We are living on the edge of harmony. It’s strangely beautiful, no?</li>
<li>On Hold, Moses Boyd and Femi Koloeso drum simultaneously. It is a rainstorm detaching.</li>
<li>You are a hyperlink to the multiverse.</li>
<li>And you are a hummingbird. And Nubya Garcia is Deontay Wilder, and you are a detaching rainstorm.</li>
