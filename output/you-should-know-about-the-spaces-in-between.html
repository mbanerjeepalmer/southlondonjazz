		<div><h1>At Peckham’s Ghost Notes, London’s best young musicians collaborate, live</h1>
<p>Ghost Notes - Wildflower Cafe during the day - is a loosely arranged collection of tables. There’s a bar, and a terrace you’re not allowed to smoke on, which doesn’t stop people. The wine is served in Duralex; the beer taps are on the wall behind the bar rather than on the bar. Everyone is beautiful and calm. Ghost Notes is ostensibly a jazz venue. It’s on the fifth or sixth floor of Peckham Levels, a repurposed multi-storey car park. </p>
<p>Every fortnight at Ghost Notes is ‘The Spaces In Between’: an improvised jazz session. The session is loosely hosted by Rudi Creswick (who plays bass for Tom Misch, Jordan Rakei), Jake Long (the drums behind Maisha and Poppy Ajudha) and Jack Stephenson-Oliver (keys for Vels Trio). The line-up past that is loose and exciting: members of Ezra Collective and Sumo Chief are often up there. Jordan Rakei, Tom Misch and Oscar Jerome have all made surprise appearances. Last night it was MC’d by Slam The Poet; in two weeks the hosts will be Emma-Jean Thackray and Cameron Dawson.  </p>
<p>To call it a session is a little misleading: the host, and the musicians who perform are of an obnoxiously high quality: totally in sync, whoever’s on the stage. Most live shows you go to aren’t this good. Most pre-prepared shows aren’t this good. Most bands setlists aren’t this good. This is serious shit. The crowd is unpretentious: they get it. The next on is on November 20. It’s free. It’s not mandatory, but strongly recommended.</p>
