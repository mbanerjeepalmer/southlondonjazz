1. You can be 4,000 miles away and Nubya Garcia will smack you in the face and you will say ‘thank you, Nubya.’
1. You don’t realise that this is what London sounds like until you hear it, then it’s all you can hear that London sounds like. 
1. Being in the right place is just as important as being at the right time.
1. It’s not your imagination: the rainstorms are getting worse every year. 
1. Paradoxical truths are harmonious. Can you hear that?
1. Joe Armon-Jones plays piano like Aladdin Sane, who plays piano like Cecil Taylor, more than anything else.
1. Nubya Garcia is a bullet that cold rocks you. No yellow ribbon, no swastika.
1. Nubya Garcia is an open-top bus tour of the mind.
1. Nubya Garcia is Juan Román Riquelme reincarnate.
1. Horoscopes are all well and good, but you can only find true intimacy in a fortune cookie.
1. This record is not recommended to anyone with a history of heart disease.
1. Hummingbirds aren’t native to Peckham, but they should be.
1. This record is, however, recommended to pregnant women.
1. This record will be the next time you consume something and it makes you feel better.
1. Striving for wellness is modern Puritanism. Pious living will not lead to immortality.
1. That said, it might not be a bad idea.
1. Nubya Garcia punches like Deontay Wilder. 
1. It’s okay to be in two minds: just be confident of both of them.
1. It’s okay to feel two paradoxical things: that’s just what it feels like to sense the multiverse.
1. Nubya Garcia senses the multiverse: just listen to her, just look at the album cover.
1. It’s all your imagination: the rainstorms are not getting worse every year. 
1. Listen: paradoxical truths are detaching. We are living on the edge of harmony. It’s strangely beautiful, no?
1. On Hold, Moses Boyd and Femi Koloeso drum simultaneously. It is a rainstorm detaching.
1. You are a hyperlink to the multiverse.
1. And you are a hummingbird. And Nubya Garcia is Deontay Wilder, and you are a detaching rainstorm.
