If you want to understand the 'new wave of jazz coming out of the UK' you can't just look at the people on stage. The action happens off-stage. Footballers have agents, politicians have strategists and the UK's new jazz musicians have Jazz re:freshed.

**Mau Mau Bar in West London**

Jazz re:freshed has held a residency at May Mau Bar every Thursday since 2003. For 16 years they've given young musicians a space to develop.

Don't turn up on time. You'll sit at the bar for three hours. Two hours in  you get a bag of crisps to break the evening up a bit. Everyone else turns up 10 minutes before the music starts. They pack the narrow space in front of the stage..

On my first visit I saw Roella Oloro Quintet. Her music is complex, pre-planned. Her quintet read sheet music on stage, carefully. It's dramatic too - especially with Isobella Burnham on bass. She drives.

**Jazz Cafe in North London**

Here everyone'sstanding still. There are speakers in the loos and music stops around the same time of night it starts at Mau Mau bar. We're here to hear Jazz re:freshed's Sounds of 2019: Vertaal, Chelsea Carmichael and Nihilism.

Nihilism's 'Beast Mode' was the stand-out. It initially followed the same structure as the rest of their songs: choppy, loud, choppy, loud again. Super effective, especially when the violin player goes in.


[Listen to a version on Spotify (although it's a lot weaker).](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Exp7dTwsaJAEzeVNW7KLA?si=VcoODMOCRjWg1Oo1d_iLRQ)

**Ghost Notes in South London**

Jazz re:freshed is also a record label. Like the Mau Mau bar sessions, its 5ive series is a space for new musicians. So I'm back at Ghost Notes for the launch of Rosie Turton’s Rosie’s 5ive.

[Rosie plays the trombone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D4reewr9Cc)

he trombone has an image problem. And Turton’s trombone, despite her bandleader status, was lost a little in the mix. That was a shame; [the EP is strong.](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ecE3kT7P76f7ZUtEvnL9X?si=ivjefV9ZSg-0gwjDHzRW5A)

And I'll go to see anything where Jake Long is on drums. 
**Where now?**
Jazz re:freshed started before Arsenal's Invincibles season, and outlasted their trophy drought and Arsène Wenger. Along with Brownswood, it's become central to new jazz music in the UK. To do this it's received £287,385 from Arts Council England between 2015 and 2018. It's due [£523,180](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/national-portfolio-2018-22/more-data-2018-22) from them in the following three years. And Rosie Turton is making it into Apple Music playlists.
