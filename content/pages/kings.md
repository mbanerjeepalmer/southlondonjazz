‘Kings of the Road’ is boring until the car smashes into the lake, which is lucky, because that happens pretty much at the beginning.

I would like to drive a car into a lake on a hot day. But I can’t drive.

This film is about as good as a partly-shaved face. Wim Wenders is good at exteriors. In this film there are too many interiors.

This film gets 6.2.
